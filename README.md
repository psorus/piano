Can you generate music without machine learning?


To play music it uses a website

https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano

main.py sends keys (so the website gonna have to be open and activated. After running each code you have 3 seconds to go to the website) for one song

infinity.py runs main.py forever
